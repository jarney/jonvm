# Jon's VM

This code is a Java virtual machine implemented in JavaScript.  It is being implemented as a part of a [YouTube series on
the Java virtual machine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36h8sHUVQCjImum595PrLR_0PZibGtS9).  The aim is to clearly explain the internal workings of a JVM so that people can gain an intuition
for the types of things that a typical virtual machine must account for and to promote a better understanding of the language
and its corresponding runtime.

Each video implements a portion of the virtual machine which is then committed to this repository and tagged appropriately.
